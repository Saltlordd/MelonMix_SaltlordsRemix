# Melon Mix (Android)

KH Melon Mix on Android.

I couldn't find an Android port of KH Melon Mix so I attempted to make one that runs on my Anbernic RG505. One
widescreen screen, camera on the right stick, HD cutscenes, remastered music. It's
[melonDS-android](https://github.com/rafaelvcaetano/melonDS-android) with the [KH Melon Mix](https://github.com/vitor251093/KHMelonMix) features ported into it.

I built and tested this on an RG505 and nothing else. You're welcome to run it on
other devices and to build on the code, but I can't promise anything beyond my own
setup. If something breaks, open a bug report in [Discussions](https://github.com/Nireves333/melonMix-android/discussions) here, not on KH Melon Mix or melonDS. I'll try to fix issues when I can :)

There's a ready-made APK on the
[releases page](https://github.com/Nireves333/melonMix-android/releases). Setup,
building from source, asset packs and known issues are all in
**[the guide](./GUIDE.md)**.

## Features

- The whole game on one widescreen screen. The HUD, minimap and command menu are
  moved onto it.
- Upscaled internal resolution. 3x holds (mostly) 60fps on the RG505 in normal non-overclocked mode.
- Camera on the right stick. Lock On and Switch Target get their own buttons, and
  the command menu goes on the d-pad.
- A "KH layout" button in the settings that applies all the recommended bindings
  at once.
- HD cutscene replacement with subtitles in six languages (Days only).
- Remastered music replacement with proper loop points (both games).
- The app itself is reworked for the two games: KH styled game select screen, menu
  sounds, and settings cut down to what these games actually need/use.

Not in it: texture replacement, HD cutscenes for Re:coded (upstream doesn't have
those yet either), Lua scripting.

Possible update: Touch controls, when I have time :)

## ROMs

This repo has no ROMs, no BIOS files and no game assets, and I won't link to any.
Dump your own games, and use the **US versions**: that's what the Melon Mix
enhancements are made for. EU and JP ROMs work with limited support and can
glitch (see the guide). Please don't ask.

## Credits

This project is a port of other people's work:

  come from them: vitor251093, justedni, Kite2810, sandwichwater, DaniKH1 and their
  community. If you're on PC, use their version.
- [melonDS-android](https://github.com/rafaelvcaetano/melonDS-android) by
  rafaelvcaetano, the app this is built on.
- [melonDS](https://github.com/melonDS-emu/melonDS), the emulator under everything.
